This application is an example of php GUI app using Glade(GTK).
Application realises interface for calculator.

It has two files:
calc.php - php instructions(the file that should be run)
calc.glade - glade interface

Glade file may be changed in any Glade editor(I used Glade Interface Designer).

To make it works you need PHP 5.1+ with php-gtk installed. Latter may be found here: http://gtk.php.net/download.php
